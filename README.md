# done_list_app
This app was conceived and created as my solo capstone project for Prime Digital Academy. I wanted to make an application where I could enter a list of activities into a text box, and have those items sorted into an array and send to a PostgreSQL database to be retrieved and viewed based on selected dates.

Application allows user to create a login, record tasks done that day, and then view all tasks done for the current week. Additionally, user can select any other custom range of dates to view other tasks accomplished in the past.

In the future, I would like to change the display of the current week's tasks so that each date's tasks are displayed in their own separate container - one for each day of the week.

I would also like to add functionality to re-use previously entered tasks using a checkbox, for tasks which are entered on a frequent or recurring basis.
